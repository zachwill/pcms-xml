# AGENTS.md — `pcms/ui/`

## Purpose

UI/reference notes that help answer: “What should we be able to show once PCMS is modeled correctly in Postgres?”

## Rules

- Treat these notes as inspiration, not truth.
- When a UI pattern implies a derived metric, document the derivation separately and tie it back to PCMS fields (and/or the CBA).
- Keep additions lightweight: prefer short notes and links/labels over dumping entire pages.
