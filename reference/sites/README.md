# PCMS UI Notes

This folder contains notes from external sites that display contract and salary-cap data clearly.

These notes are here to:
- capture useful **information architecture** patterns (filters, timelines, rollups)
- identify what end-users expect to search and compare
- help guide which queries the Postgres schema should support well

## Important Caveat

These sources are **not authoritative** for PCMS semantics.
Use them as product/UI inspiration, while validating any derived calculations or terminology against PCMS artifacts and (when relevant) the CBA.
