# PCMS — NBA Team Contracts and Cap Management Sheet

## Overview

### Description
Consolidates each NBA team’s roster, contract details, cap/tax position, exceptions, and draft assets into a single, per-team report. It supports multi-year planning by showing year-by-year salaries alongside cap rules and asset inventories.

### Main UI Patterns
- Primary pattern: Data table
- Supporting patterns: Dashboard-style summary blocks and right-rail supplemental tables

### Notes
- Single view per team removes context switching across pages for contracts, cap math, exceptions, and draft picks
- A global legend standardizes color/symbol meaning across modules, enabling rapid scan of dense grids
- Forward-looking, year-by-year columns match how front offices plan across multiple seasons
- Clean separation of concerns: core roster grid, financial summaries, assets, and contract nuances live in distinct zones

## Key Modules

### 1. Team Header and Global Legend
- Description: Sets shared vocabulary for colors/symbols used across all tables to reduce cognitive load when scanning dense data
- Core Elements:
  - Team name
  - Legend for salary colors (e.g., player option, team option, FA amount) and symbol codes (e.g., X for no protection, / for partial)
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Users reference legend while scanning grids to decode meaning without extra text
- Notes:
  - Keeping the legend persistently visible or easily reachable preserves scan speed on long pages

### 2. Primary Roster & Salaries Grid
- Description: The main planning surface. Puts player-level salaries by season alongside contract metadata and trade constraints
- Core Elements:
  - Player identification
  - Year-by-year salary columns (e.g., 2025–2030)
  - Contractual context: protection status, free agency type (UFA/RFA), age, years of service
  - Trade-related notes: restrictions, bonuses, no-trade clauses
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Horizontal scrolling to view future years
  - Color-coded cells for options/FA placeholders
  - Symbol flags direct attention to supplemental tables for details (e.g., partial guarantees)
- Notes:
  - The grid is the anchor; all other modules contextualize or summarize what appears here

### 3. Financial Summary Blocks (Left Side)
- Description: Aggregates granular contract data into an executive summary of team obligations and cap/tax position
- Core Elements:
  - Roster count and total salaries by season
  - Cap management: Team Salary (cap purposes), Cap Room/deficit, amounts over/under Tax and Apron levels
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Move from player-level inspection to team-level outcomes to evaluate flexibility, tax exposure, and room
- Notes:
  - Serves as the decision anchor for trades, signings, and timing questions

### 4. Trade & Draft Asset Summary (Left Side)
- Description: Inventory of tradable cash and draft capital with conditions/protections
- Core Elements:
  - Available cash in trades
  - First- and second-round picks with notes on trades/protections
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Cross-reference with the cap summary to test feasibility of moves across seasons
- Notes:
  - Keeping capital and constraints in one place reduces the need for external pick trackers

### 5. Draft Rights List (Right Side)
- Description: Tracks rights to players not on the roster, informing stashed assets and future signings
- Core Elements:
  - Player names and basic rights status
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Occasional reference when considering future roster spots and exception usage

### 6. Exceptions (Right Side)
- Description: Shows available exceptions and expirations that drive acquisition mechanisms
- Core Elements:
  - Non-taxpayer MLE, Bi-Annual, TPEs, values, and expiration dates
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Timing-sensitive planning for signings/trades relative to expirations

### 7. Partial/Conditional Protections (Right Side)
- Description: Explains guarantees and trigger dates that affect flexibility and waive-and-stretch decisions
- Core Elements:
  - Guarantee amounts, trigger dates, and conditions
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Users follow flags from the main grid to check exact terms here

### 8. Incentive Compensation (Right Side)
- Description: Clarifies likely vs. unlikely incentives that influence cap calculations and projections
- Core Elements:
  - Incentive descriptions, amounts, "Likely" vs "Unlikely" classification
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Reference during cap scenario work and when reconciling salary totals to cap math

## Best Ideas

### 1. One-Stop Consolidation
- Why It Works: Reduces context switching across contracts, cap math, exceptions, and draft capital. Decisions can be explored without leaving the page
- Where It Breaks Down: Density can overwhelm on smaller screens; without filters, targeted queries (e.g., "only 2027 expirings") can be slow

### 2. Color- and Symbol-Based Encoding
- Why It Works: Encodes status (options, FA placeholders, protections) directly in cells, enabling rapid visual parsing across many rows and years
- Where It Breaks Down: Color dependence can hinder accessibility and print use; symbol overloading requires constant legend reference for new users

### 3. Granular-to-Summary Hierarchy
- Why It Works: Mirrors analyst workflow—inspect a contract, then immediately see cap/tax consequences and asset availability
- Where It Breaks Down: Cross-cutting questions (e.g., "cap if we waive two partials and renounce exceptions") require mental simulation without dedicated scenario tools

### 4. Forward-Looking Year Columns
- Why It Works: Multi-year columns surface bottlenecks (salary cliffs or clusters) and opportunities (cap space openings) at a glance
- Where It Breaks Down: Uncertainties (options, incentives, non-guarantees) require assumptions that aren’t always explicit inline

### 5. Flag-and-Detail Pattern for Complex Terms
- Why It Works: Keeps the main grid clean while supporting drill-down via a dedicated detail table for partial guarantees and conditions
- Where It Breaks Down: Split-context reading introduces jump cost; without deep links or hover details, users must manually align items

### 6. Executive Cap Summary Anchored to Rule Thresholds
- Why It Works: Converts raw payroll into decision-ready terms (cap room, tax, apron), which are the actual constraints
- Where It Breaks Down: Requires timely updates to league thresholds; assumptions (e.g., projected cap) should be explicit to avoid misreads

## Metadata

### Data Density
High. Wide, multi-year grid plus multiple side blocks. Optimized for large screens; scanning relies on color and compact labeling.

### Notable Omissions
- No explicit filtering, sorting, or search in the main grid
- No scenario modeling (e.g., toggles for exercising options, waiving partials, or including/excluding incentives)
- No explicit "assumptions panel" for projected cap/tax/apron numbers or methodology
- No timestamps or data provenance (e.g., last updated, source links)
- No accessibility aids for color vision (e.g., patterns, alt labels)
- No export/print-optimized view indicated
- No mobile-friendly adaptation noted

### Misc Notes
- Keeping the legend persistent, adding quick filters (year, status, FA type), and inline tooltips for symbols would preserve the clean layout while improving speed for targeted queries
- Deep-linking flags in the grid to their corresponding rows in the detail tables would reduce jump cost and errors
