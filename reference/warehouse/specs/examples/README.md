# Examples — `reference/warehouse/specs/examples/`

These docs are **worked examples / scenario worksheets** from Sean’s workbook exports.

They are useful for seeing the math applied end-to-end, but they are **not canonical rules**. For the canonical waiver/buyout/stretch/set-off rules, start with:

- [`../buyout-waiver-math.md`](../buyout-waiver-math.md)
