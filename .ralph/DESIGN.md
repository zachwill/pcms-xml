# Design Evolution Queue (`web/`)

This file is for **design evolution**, not design hygiene.

## Mission

Raise the overall design quality of non-Salary-Book surfaces in `web/` by improving:
- scan speed
- information hierarchy
- interaction predictability
- density/readability balance
- navigation/pivot clarity

Salary Book is the reference quality bar and is **read-only** for this loop.

## Hard guardrail

Do not modify Salary Book files while running `agents/design.ts`.

## What counts as a good task

A good task is one surface + one user flow, with a clear hypothesis and measurable acceptance criteria.

A bad task is broad cosmetic churn (for example, repo-wide class sweeps) with no flow outcome.

## Rubric (score 1-5 before and after)

1. Scan speed
2. Information hierarchy
3. Interaction predictability
4. Density/readability balance
5. Navigation/pivots
