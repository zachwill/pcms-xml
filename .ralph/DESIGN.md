# Design Evolution Backlog (`web/`)

North star:
- Entity index pages are explorer workbenches (Salary Book-like interaction model, not clones).
- Fast scanning, meaningful knobs, dense interactive rows, and sidebar drill-ins.
- Canonical pattern: `#commandbar` + `#maincanvas` + `#rightpanel-base` + `#rightpanel-overlay`.
- Salary Book remains read-only and is the interaction quality bar.
- Team Summary, System Values, and Two-Way Utility evolve in parallel toward stronger workbench UX.

Rubric (1-5):
1) Scan speed
2) Information hierarchy
3) Interaction predictability
4) Density/readability balance
5) Navigation/pivots

Current focus reset (2026-02-12):
- Push index surfaces away from `<table>` rendering toward dense flex-row workbench grammar.
- Two-Way Utility row anatomy is the nearest non-Salary-Book reference for this migration.
- Salary Book Tankathon table-to-flex migration is now enabled as a strict exception (only the Tankathon frame partial; no other Salary Book files).

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /agents — replace table rendering with flex-row workspace and compress Sort controls
  - Problem: `/agents` still uses table markup for both agents/agencies lenses, and the commandbar Sort cluster is too wide/noisy to scan quickly.
  - Hypothesis: A dense flex-row list plus a compact Sort selector + stacked Direction control will improve scan speed and reduce commandbar crowding.
  - What changed:
    - Added a dedicated agents commandbar partial (`web/app/views/entities/agents/_commandbar.html.erb`) and switched `index.html.erb` to render it so commandbar behavior/markup is shared between initial load and SSE refresh.
    - Compressed Sort controls in `/agents` commandbar: replaced long sort-key radio run with a compact `select` (`#agent-sort-key-select`) and stacked direction radios in the same Sort knob column.
    - Extended shared entity commandbar renderer (`web/app/views/entities/shared/_commandbar.html.erb`) with a `select` knob type (`choices`, `width_class`, `data-bind`, `on_change`) to support compact control patterns.
    - Rebuilt `/agents` workspace main list (`web/app/views/entities/agents/_workspace_main.html.erb`) for both agents and agencies lenses as dense div/flex rows with sticky headers; removed table markup entirely while preserving row click/open-overlay behavior and overlay highlight states.
    - Updated agents SSE refresh (`web/app/controllers/entities/agents_sse_controller.rb`) to patch `#commandbar` together with maincanvas/sidebar/overlay so knob markup and state stay synchronized after lens/sort changes.
    - Updated integration coverage (`web/test/integration/entities_agents_index_test.rb`) to assert compact sort select presence, commandbar patching in SSE response, and no entity table markup in `/agents` index response.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Scan rhythm is now consistent with newer workbench surfaces: dense flex rows, fixed column grammar, and faster eye-tracking across rows.
    - Sort control footprint is materially smaller, reducing commandbar crowding and making directional intent clearer in one stacked knob column.
    - One SSE response now keeps commandbar + maincanvas + sidebar + overlay aligned, which improves interaction predictability during rapid filter/sort toggling.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_agents_index_test.rb -i "/agents refresh|agency overlay exposes/"`
    - `rg "<table" web/app/views/entities/agents/_workspace_main.html.erb`

    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Full-page `/agents` integration assertion path still hits the known `tailwind.css` test asset load-path issue; keep running targeted SSE/integration subsets until that harness issue is resolved.
    - Consider extracting a shared entity flex-row metric cell partial once `/agencies` migrates to reduce duplicated percentile/value cell markup.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /players — shift from single table-rail scan to sectioned flex rows (Two-Way Utility style)
  - Problem: `/players` remained visually table-like (single rigid rail + dense numeric columns), which made long scans feel spreadsheet-heavy instead of workbench-oriented.
  - Hypothesis: Sectioned flex rows (with lightweight section headers) would preserve density while improving orientation and reducing cognitive reset during long scans.
  - What changed:
    - Added section-bucketing state in `web/app/controllers/entities/players_controller.rb`:
      - introduced ordered player section definitions (status and constraint buckets),
      - grouped filtered rows into `@player_sections`,
      - computed per-section row/team counts plus aligned cap/total rollups for header context.
    - Reworked `web/app/views/entities/players/_workspace_main.html.erb` from one uninterrupted lane to explicit section blocks:
      - kept the existing global sticky column header,
      - added sticky per-section headers (`top-8`) with section title/subtitle and cap rollups aligned to the same cap columns as row cells,
      - preserved existing dense row anatomy, row click→overlay flow, and Pin A/Pin B controls.
    - Expanded integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_players_index_test.rb` to assert section container/header presence in SSE refresh payloads and active-lens section routing (`trade_kicker` bucket precedence).
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Long scans now re-anchor at each section boundary instead of forcing one continuous spreadsheet pass.
    - Sticky section headers keep posture context visible while preserving numeric column alignment for cap comparison.
    - Compare and overlay mechanics stay unchanged, so interaction predictability remains high while hierarchy improves.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_players_index_test.rb -i "/players refresh uses one sse response|players refresh applies trade kicker constraint with horizon-aware cap labels|players refresh pin action updates compare slots without forcing overlay selection/"`
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_players_index_test.rb -i "/players refresh preserves selected overlay when selected row remains visible|players refresh clears selected overlay when selected row is filtered out/"`

    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Full-page `/players` integration assertions still hit the known `tailwind.css` test asset load-path issue; continue using focused SSE subsets until harness setup is fixed.
    - Consider extracting a shared section-header partial once `/teams` adopts sectioned cap lanes to reduce duplicated rollup-header markup.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /teams — reframe cap-pressure rows into sectioned flex lanes instead of table-like striping
  - Problem: `/teams` rows were dense/useful but still read as one flat pass, which made pressure triage feel like spreadsheet scanning instead of lane-based workbench analysis.
  - Hypothesis: Pressure-bucket section lanes with sticky lane headers would improve first-pass orientation while preserving compare + overlay flows.
  - What changed:
    - Added pressure-lane section state in `web/app/controllers/entities/teams_controller.rb`:
      - introduced ordered pressure section definitions,
      - grouped filtered teams into `@team_sections`,
      - computed per-section rollups (cap/tax/apron/tax-owed + roster + taxpayer/repeater counts).
    - Reworked `web/app/views/entities/teams/_workspace_main.html.erb` from one continuous lane to sectioned pressure lanes:
      - kept the existing global sticky column header,
      - added sticky lane headers (`top-8`) with lane title/subtitle and numeric rollups aligned to row columns,
      - preserved row hover, row click → overlay, and Pin A/Pin B compare actions.
    - Updated `web/app/views/entities/teams/_rightpanel_base.html.erb` to surface “Pressure lanes in view” counts so sidebar posture mirrors the sectioned board.
    - Expanded integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_teams_index_test.rb` for section container presence and lens-driven section routing.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Pressure transitions are now explicit while scrolling, reducing cognitive reset during long scans.
    - Lane headers keep cap/tax/apron context anchored with aligned totals, which improves triage speed without sacrificing density.
    - Compare slots, selected-row highlighting, and sidebar drill-ins remain unchanged, preserving interaction predictability.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_teams_index_test.rb -i "/teams refresh|teams sidebar/"`

    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 5 → 5
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Full-page `/teams` index integration assertions still hit the known `tailwind.css` test asset load-path issue; continue focused SSE subsets until harness setup is fixed.
    - Consider extracting shared section-header/row partials between `/players` and `/teams` after the next index migration to reduce duplicated lane markup.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /agencies — migrate agency explorer from table markup to flex-row workbench scan
  - Problem: `/agencies` was still table-rendered, which broke visual consistency with newer workbench-style index surfaces and slowed row-level triage.
  - Hypothesis: A flex-row workspace with the same identity/metric grammar as `/agents` and Two-Way Utility would improve scan continuity and make pivots more predictable.
  - What changed:
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/agencies/_workspace_main.html.erb` from `<table>` markup to dense flex-row workbench rows with a sticky column header (`#agencies-flex-header`).
    - Preserved agency row interaction grammar (row click/keyboard open overlay, selected-row highlight treatment, and row-level canonical page pivots).
    - Kept numeric metric columns in `font-mono tabular-nums` and retained percentile secondary lines via `entity-cell-two-line` cells.
    - Added lightweight workspace scan chips in the maincanvas header (live books / inactive+live / live risk) to front-load posture context before drill-in.
    - Updated `web/test/integration/entities_agencies_index_test.rb` assertions to verify the flex header is present and `<table>` markup is absent in both index and SSE refresh responses.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Agency scanning now matches the newer entity workbench grammar (sticky compact header + dense flex rows), improving continuity across index surfaces.
    - Posture chips and row-level status tokens make triage intent visible before opening the overlay.
    - Overlay/pivot behavior remains stable, so analysts gain faster scan speed without relearning interactions.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_agencies_index_test.rb -i "/agencies refresh|agencies sidebar overlay/"`

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /drafts — de-table grid/list views and make ownership risk severity visible before drill-in
  - Problem: `/drafts` still relies on table-heavy rendering across grid/picks/selections, and users must click repeatedly to discover high-risk ownership cells.
  - Hypothesis: Moving all three views to dense flex-based workbench rows/cells plus explicit risk severity encoding will improve triage speed before drill-in.
=======
- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /drafts — improve grid triage by making ownership risk severity visible before drill-in
  - Problem: Grid users had to open many cells to determine which ownership slots were normal, at-risk, or critical.
  - Hypothesis: Inline severity encoding + in-surface legend would make triage faster and make drill-ins intentional.

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Grid, picks, and selections presentations in `/drafts` use flex/div row-cell grammar (no `<table>` rendering in `_results`).
    - Grid cells expose a consistent 3-tier risk treatment (normal / at-risk / critical) with legend copy in-surface.
    - Risk treatment uses the same underlying risk scoring as sidebar summary counts.
    - Overlay selection state remains preserved through sort/lens/view SSE refresh when selected item remains visible.
    - Team and year pivots remain one click from row/cell or overlay.
  - Rubric (before → target):
=======
  - What changed:
    - Added a shared grid risk-tier derivation in `DraftsController` (`normal` / `at_risk` / `critical`) and wired each cell to carry tier label + ownership risk score.
    - Added sidebar summary tier counts (`severity_counts`) computed from the same tier logic used by existing at-risk/critical sidebar KPIs.
    - Updated grid cells in `_results` to render visible tier chips, risk score (`R#`), and compact encumbrance tokens before drill-in.
    - Added an in-surface ownership risk legend above the grid and a matching “Grid risk tiers” explainer block in `#rightpanel-base`.
    - Kept existing overlay open/restore flow intact (grid refresh still preserves selected cell when visible).
    - Expanded integration coverage to assert SSE grid refresh payload includes tier legend/treatment and risk-score encoding.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Analysts can now identify critical ownership cells immediately without opening each overlay.
    - Legend + chips create a stable, shared severity grammar across main grid and sidebar snapshot.
    - Triage remains predictable during sort/lens refresh because one SSE response still patches results + sidebar + overlay state together.

- [x] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/two-way-utility — add intent search to find one player fast without leaving team-section context
  - Problem: Users scanning many team sections cannot quickly jump to a known player name/id.
  - Hypothesis: Commandbar intent search with in-context filtering/highlighting will cut navigation time while preserving workbench density.

    - web/test/integration/tools_two_way_utility_test.rb
  - What changed:
    - Added a dedicated Two-Way Utility commandbar partial and wired `/tools/two-way-utility/sse/refresh` to patch `#commandbar` + `#maincanvas` + `#rightpanel-base` + `#rightpanel-overlay` in one SSE response.
    - Added `intent` workspace state (controller + signals + URL sync + state query) so name/player_id search is shareable and preserved across refreshes.
    - Added commandbar player-intent controls (`#two-way-intent-input`, Apply/Clear) that drive SSE refresh without leaving team-section context.
    - Applied intent-aware board treatment: intent chips in workspace header/team sections, row-level highlight treatment, and inline `INTENT` status token.
    - Kept compare/overlay flows stable while migrating compare actions to canonical query keys (`compare_action`, `compare_slot`) with legacy fallback parsing in controller.
    - Updated overlay share link to retain active intent state.
    - Expanded integration coverage for intent filtering/highlight behavior, commandbar patching/signals, canonical compare params, and overlay-preservation behavior.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Analysts can jump directly to a known player from the commandbar and still read the result in-team, instead of manually scanning across sections.
    - Team grouping remains intact while matches are visibly emphasized, preserving orientation in dense board workflows.
    - One SSE refresh keeps commandbar, board, sidebar summary, compare slots, and overlay selection synchronized, improving predictability.

- [ ] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/salary-book (Tankathon view only) — replace table board with Salary Book-style flex rows
  - Problem: Tankathon view still renders as a traditional table, which feels inconsistent with the Salary Book flex-row scanning grammar and slows visual comparison.
  - Hypothesis: Rebuilding Tankathon rows/cells as dense flex divs (matching Salary Book row anatomy) will improve scan rhythm while preserving one-click team switching.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/tools/salary_book/_maincanvas_tankathon_frame.html.erb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Tankathon board renders with div/flex row primitives (no `<table>` in the Tankathon frame partial).
    - Team row identity + standings metrics remain aligned and scannable at current density.
    - Row click still dispatches `salarybook-switch-team` and switches the active team as before.

    - Returned `/agents` view opens in agents mode with scoped context visible.
    - Existing agency overlay behavior is unaffected.

- [ ] [P3] [TOOL] /tools/system-values — persist section visibility state in shareable URL
  - Problem: Section visibility toggles are client-only, so shared links reopen with default visibility and lose analyst framing.
  - Hypothesis: Encoding visibility toggles in URL + SSE state will improve collaboration and replayability of analysis views.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/tools/system_values/show.html.erb
    - web/app/views/tools/system_values/_commandbar.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/tools/system_values_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/tools_system_values_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Visibility toggles (System/Tax/Minimum/Rookie) are reflected in URL query state.
    - Reloading or sharing URL restores identical visible-section layout.
    - SSE refresh preserves overlay and visibility state together.
    - Scrollspy and section wayfinding ignore hidden sections correctly.

    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
