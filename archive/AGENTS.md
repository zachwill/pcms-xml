# AGENTS.md — `archive/`

This directory is for **archived / legacy materials**.

Nothing in here is required for the current PCMS/NBA/SportRadar ingests. Treat it as historical context only.

## What’s here

### `archive/sean-legacy/`
Older notes and exports from Sean’s legacy tooling.

- Prefer the **current** workbook exports + specs in:
  - `reference/warehouse/` (see `reference/warehouse/AGENTS.md`)

If you *are* using the legacy material:
- read `archive/sean-legacy/AGENTS.md` first
- don’t retrofit assumptions back into current tables/functions without checking the newer `reference/warehouse/specs/` evidence
