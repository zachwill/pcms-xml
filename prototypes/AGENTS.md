# prototypes/AGENTS.md

This folder contains **throwaway / reference implementations** that are kept around for:
- interaction/UX reference
- SQL/API contract history
- design system snapshots

They are **not** the canonical app.

Canonical UI lives in:
- `web/` (Rails + Datastar)

Current prototypes:
- `prototypes/salary-book-react/` — Bun + React Salary Book prototype
