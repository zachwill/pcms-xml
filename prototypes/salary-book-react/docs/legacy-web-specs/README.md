# Legacy web specs (archived)

These docs were moved from `web/specs/` and are kept as **historical design context**.

They capture OG mental models that shaped the product, but they are no longer the primary source for current `web/` implementation decisions.

## Use these for

- original interaction philosophy
- early Salary Book / trade / entity workspace design intent
- historical rationale when reviewing old commits

## Use these as primary sources instead (for current work)

- `reference/sites/INTERACTION_MODELS.md`
- `reference/datastar/insights.md`
- `reference/datastar/rails.md`
- `reference/datastar/basecamp.md`
- `web/AGENTS.md`
- live `web/app/views/*` and `web/app/javascript/*` code
