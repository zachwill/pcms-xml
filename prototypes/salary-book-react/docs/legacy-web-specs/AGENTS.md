# AGENTS.md — legacy web specs archive

This directory is an **archive** of the former `web/specs/*` docs.

Use these files for historical context, not as primary implementation authority.

Primary docs for current `web/` work:
- `web/AGENTS.md`
- `reference/sites/INTERACTION_MODELS.md`
- `reference/datastar/insights.md`
- `reference/datastar/rails.md`

If current implementation and these legacy specs conflict, trust the current implementation and primary docs.
