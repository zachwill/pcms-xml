#### Notes
- This table tracks the *active* injury report. It is intended to be overwritten (UPSERT) with the latest data from the NBA's `Injury List` endpoint.
- `team_id` will be `0` for players not on an active roster.
- `return_date` is stored as `text` as it often contains descriptive strings like "Out for Season" or "Early January" rather than strictly formatted dates.
- All columns except identifiers come directly from the `InjuryListPlayer` schema in the NBA Stats API.
- Identity is managed via `nba_id` (the NBA's official `personId`).
