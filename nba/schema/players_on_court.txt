### nba.players_on_court

- game_id text REFERENCES nba.games(game_id)
- poc_json jsonb

- created_at timestamptz
- updated_at timestamptz
- fetched_at timestamptz

#### Constraints & Indexes
- PRIMARY KEY (game_id)
- INDEX ON (game_id)
- INDEX USING gin (poc_json)

#### Notes
- Sourced from `/api/stats/poc`.
- Stored as **one row per game** as JSONB to avoid an event-level row explosion.
- The payload maps play-by-play actions (or action numbers) to the 10 players on court.
- If we later need event-level joins for performance-critical analytics, we can generate a derived table/materialized view from `poc_json`.
