### nba.ngss_boxscores

- game_id text REFERENCES nba.games(game_id)
- ngss_game_id text
- boxscore_json jsonb

- created_at timestamptz
- updated_at timestamptz
- fetched_at timestamptz

#### Constraints & Indexes
- PRIMARY KEY (game_id)
- INDEX ON (ngss_game_id)
- INDEX USING gin (boxscore_json)

#### Notes
- Following the "Non-Negotiable Design Principles" in `AGENTS.md`, we store the full NGSS boxscore payload as JSONB to prevent premature schema explosion and preserve all legacy fields.
- NGSS boxscores often contain metrics not found in standard NBA API boxscores, such as `EfficiencyGameScore`, detailed `PointsInThePaint` breakdowns, and granular `FoulsOffensive`.
- We use the official `game_id` as the primary key for alignment with the rest of the `nba` schema.
- `ngss_game_id` is stored for direct lookups against Genius Sports systems.
