#### Notes
- This table serves as the person-mapping layer for NGSS-sourced data (Rosters, Boxscores, PBP).
- It maps NGSS `PersonId` to official `nba_id` and `team_id` when possible.
- `ngss_person_id`: The Genius Sports identifier for the individual (player, official, or staff).
- `is_player`, `is_official`, `is_team_staff`: Booleans derived from the NGSS person flags.
- `team_role`: For staff, specifies their role (e.g., Head Coach, Assistant Coach).
- `player_status`: NGSS status (e.g., 'Active', 'Inactive').
- `not_playing_reason`: Stores the enum-based reason for DNP/DND (e.g., 'DnpCoach', 'DnpInjury').
- `not_playing_description`: Any additional text provided for the absence.
