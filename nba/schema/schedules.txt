#### Constraints & Indexes
- PRIMARY KEY (season_year, league_id)
- INDEX ON (stats_season_id)
- INDEX ON (ngss_season_id)
- INDEX ON (league_id)
- INDEX ON (season_label)

#### Notes
- `season_year` is the starting year of the season (e.g., 2023 for the 2023-24 season).
- `season_label` is the display string for the season (e.g., "2023-24").
- `league_id` identifiers: "00" (NBA), "10" (WNBA), "20" (G League).
- `stats_season_id`, `roster_season_id`, `schedule_season_id`, and `standings_season_id` are the 5-digit identifiers used by various NBA Stats endpoints (e.g., "22023"). These are sourced from the `/api/schedule/seasoncalendar` endpoint.
- `ngss_season_id` stores the Genius Sports (NGSS) identifier for cross-referencing legacy or specific data feeds.
- `weeks_json` is an extracted array of the season's weeks (from `leagueSchedule.weeks`), providing easy access to `weekNumber`, `weekName`, `startDate`, and `endDate`.
- `full_schedule_json` stores the raw response from the `/api/schedule/full` endpoint.
- `broadcasters_json` stores the raw response from the `/api/schedule/broadcasters` endpoint, covering TV, radio, and OTT.
- `season_calendar_json` stores the raw response from the `/api/schedule/seasoncalendar` endpoint.
- This table acts as a bulk metadata landing zone for season-wide configurations. While `nba.games` contains individual game records, `nba.schedules` preserves the overall season structure and week definitions.
