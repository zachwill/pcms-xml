### nba.ngss_pbp

- game_id text REFERENCES nba.games(game_id)
- ngss_game_id text
- ngss_pbp_json jsonb

- created_at timestamptz
- updated_at timestamptz
- fetched_at timestamptz

#### Constraints & Indexes
- PRIMARY KEY (game_id)
- INDEX ON (ngss_game_id)
- INDEX USING gin (ngss_pbp_json)

#### Notes
- Following the "PBP Guidance" in `AGENTS.md`, this table stores **one row per game** containing the full NGSS (Genius Sports) Play-by-Play event stream.
- We use the official `game_id` as the primary key/link, but also store `ngss_game_id` for cross-referencing.
- `ngss_pbp_json` is preferred over the official PBP when fields like challenge context, officials attribution, or "who called it" details are required.
- Storing as JSONB prevents premature schema explosion.
