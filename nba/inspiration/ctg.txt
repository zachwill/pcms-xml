# CTG — League Four Factors

## Overview

### Description
A league-wide view of NBA team performance on the Four Factors, presented as a sortable, filterable table. It lets users slice context (season, opponent strength, rest, location, etc.) and compare teams on offense and defense metrics with league ranks and a league-average baseline.

### Main UI Patterns
- Primary: Data table
- Supporting: Control panel (filters)
- Secondary: Sectional navigation and search

### Notes
- Emphasizes relative performance via color-coded ranks rather than raw values alone
- Anchors interpretation with a league-average row
- Data scope is curated (excludes garbage time and end-of-quarter heaves), shaping how users trust and apply insights

## Key Modules

### 1. Global Header + Stats Navigation + Search
- Description: Keeps users oriented and able to jump between Stats subsections (Games, Players, Teams, Salaries, League breakdowns). Search accelerates entry to specific teams/players without leaving the stats context
- Core Elements:
  - Top-level site nav (Articles, Stats, About, account)
  - Secondary Stats nav with direct links to subpages, including Four Factors
  - Prominent player/team search
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Persistent header; quick switching across related stat views
  - Search-as-navigation to bypass browsing
- Notes:
  - Pattern scales well across a stats suite: consistent mental model, reduced navigation cost

### 2. Filters and Customization Panel
- Description: Turns a static table into a contextual analysis tool by letting users specify when and against whom performance is measured
- Core Elements:
  - Season and season type (regular, playoffs)
  - Date range
  - Opponent, location (home/away), game result (win/loss)
  - Rest days for team and opponent
  - Opponent strength filters (rank by point differential, offense, defense)
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Multi-criteria filtering with immediate table updates
  - Advanced filters for strength-of-schedule and fatigue context
- Notes:
  - Reusable pattern: expose a small core filter set plus an advanced group for power users

### 3. Four Factors Data Table
- Description: Central comparative view of team efficiency split into offense and defense, with ranks and color cues for quick scanning
- Core Elements:
  - Team identity (logo, name), record, point differential
  - Offense and Defense sections with Points per Possession, eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, Free Throw Rate
  - League ranks and color-coding per metric
  - League-average row at top
  - Sortable columns
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Click-to-sort by any metric
  - Preattentive color encoding of ranks for rapid hot/cold spotting
  - Comparison to league average without leaving the table
- Notes:
  - Rank-based coloring normalizes across heterogeneous metrics, improving cross-column scan

### 4. Explanations + Data Export
- Description: Establishes data scope/assumptions and enables external analysis
- Core Elements:
  - Note on excluding garbage time and heaves
  - Download this table as CSV
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Lightweight documentation near the data
  - One-click export for reproducibility and deeper analysis
- Notes:
  - Reusable pattern: pair methodological note with export to build trust and enable workflow continuity

### 5. Footer
- Description: Standard site information and policies
- Core Elements:
  - Copyright
  - Terms
  - Privacy
  - Contact
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Static links; credibility signaling

## Best Ideas

### 1. Rank-as-Color Heatmap in Cells
- Why It Works: Uses rank to normalize disparate metrics and color to reduce scanning time. Users can spot strengths/weaknesses across offense/defense without parsing every number
- Where It Breaks Down: Without a legend or accessibility support, colorblind users may struggle; ranks can mask magnitude differences between close values

### 2. League-Average Baseline Row
- Why It Works: Provides an immediate anchor for above/below average across all metrics, reducing cognitive load and back-and-forth reference
- Where It Breaks Down: A single average hides distribution shape; percentile bands or quartiles could give more nuance

### 3. Context-Heavy Filters (Opponent Strength, Rest Days)
- Why It Works: Encodes schedule strength and fatigue, enabling apples-to-contextual-apples comparisons without leaving the interface or building custom datasets
- Where It Breaks Down: Complex filter states can be hard to track without visible chips/summaries or saved views

### 4. Curated Data Scope (Exclude Garbage Time and Heaves)
- Why It Works: Reduces noise and aligns the dataset with meaningful possessions, producing more stable comparisons
- Where It Breaks Down: Users sometimes need to compare to other public sources that include all possessions; a toggle could help

### 5. CSV Export Adjacent to Table
- Why It Works: Encourages trust and off-platform analysis; integrates with users’ workflows without friction
- Where It Breaks Down: Lacks parameterized/saved exports or API access for automated pipelines

### 6. Secondary Stats Navigation Within a Suite
- Why It Works: Keeps users in analysis mode while switching topics; consistency reduces reorientation cost
- Where It Breaks Down: If taxonomy grows, navigation can sprawl without grouping or search within the nav

## Metadata

### Data Density
High-density table across two dimensions (offense/defense) and multiple metrics, mitigated by rank-based color and sorting. The league-average row improves interpretability without additional charts

### Notable Omissions
Not described:
- Saved filter presets
- Shareable URLs for filter state
- Column customization or hiding
- Per-metric definitions/tooltips
- Color scale legend and accessibility alternatives
- Multi-sort
- Trend/sparkline views over time
- Mobile handling for wide tables
- Ability to toggle inclusion of garbage time
- Explanations of how ranks are computed under filtering

### Misc Notes
- The combination of curated possession data, context filters, rank coloring, and export creates a clear path from question to answer to external analysis
- The same table framework could support additional derived metrics or percentile bands without changing the core interaction model
