# Basketball-Reference — Player Page (Damian Lillard)

## Overview

### Description
A player hub that aggregates Damian Lillard’s identity, bio, accolades, quick stat snapshot, deep season-by-season data, and related context (news, awards, contracts). It centralizes navigation to logs, splits, shooting, and premium research tools (Stathead).

### Main UI Patterns
- Primary pattern: Data table
- Supporting patterns: Profile header, in-page anchor navigation, tabbed content switcher (Regular Season vs Playoffs)

### Notes
- Uses progressive disclosure: identity and summary at top; dense, structured tables below
- Embeds comparative context (career vs latest season, league-adjusted metrics, similarity scores)
- Table-level “Share & Export” turns static tables into reusable assets
- Integrates freemium prompts (Stathead insights) as content, not just ads

## Best Ideas

### 1. Accolades “Bling” Bar
- Why It Works: Upfront honor badges anchor reputation before details; users can calibrate expectations quickly
- Where It Breaks Down: Counts lack context (e.g., era strength, team context); not filterable by competition type

### 2. Season vs Career Summary Pullout
- Why It Works: A two-column compare compresses trend detection into a glance without extra charts
- Where It Breaks Down: Per-game framing can mislead for minute or pace changes; no quick per-possession toggle

### 3. Tabbed Regular Season / Playoffs Switch
- Why It Works: Segments two mental models of performance without duplicating layout; reduces initial screen load
- Where It Breaks Down: Hidden-by-default tab can reduce discoverability for casual users

### 4. League-Adjusted Shooting (contextualized percentages)
- Why It Works: Normalizes for era and pace, enabling cross-era reasoning with the same table scaffolding
- Where It Breaks Down: Requires literacy in adjusted metrics; limited inline definitions

### 5. Table-Level Share & Export
- Why It Works: Meets analyst workflows at the source; reduces copy/paste errors; encourages proper citation
- Where It Breaks Down: Controls can be visually subtle; batch exporting multiple tables isn’t obvious

### 6. Similarity Scores and Insights as Content
- Why It Works: Converts a static profile into a discovery path; frames questions that premium tools answer
- Where It Breaks Down: Similarity heuristics are opaque; can oversimplify player archetypes

### 7. Player-Specific Anchor Nav
- Why It Works: Reduces scroll cost on dense pages; provides a mental map of the content hierarchy
- Where It Breaks Down: If not sticky, users lose it during long scrolls; anchors don’t indicate completion or last viewed

### 8. Comprehensive Career Hub (transactions, salaries, awards)
- Why It Works: Consolidates disparate sources into one file; supports quick cross-referencing within the same session
- Where It Breaks Down: Lists are long and text-heavy; limited filters by team, date range, contract type

## Metadata

### Data Density
- High density with layered disclosure: identity and accolades up top; standardized, columnar tables below
- Consistent row-per-season pattern across categories supports scanning and export

### Notable Omissions
- Interactive visualizations (trend lines, shot charts) on the page
- Inline metric definitions/tooltips for advanced stats
- Saved views or personalization (pinning favorite tables/columns)
- Side-by-side player comparison within the page
- Batch export across multiple tables; API link surfaced on-page
- Strong mobile affordances for wide tables (frozen headers/columns, column selector)

### Misc Notes
- Freemium integration is content-led (Insights, Similarity) rather than intrusive prompts
- Uniform numbers add identity texture but little analysis value; consider linking to seasons when worn
- FAQ likely captures SEO demand for common queries and offloads basic support
