# Dunks & Threes — Player Page (Jaylen Brown)

## Overview

### Description
Provides a complete player performance profile. Combines bio and team context with season-by-season advanced metrics, career and in-season EPM trends, and a detailed game log. The “Actual” tab (default) shows observed outcomes; “Expected” and “Shooting” are alternative views.

### Main UI Patterns
- Profile dashboard with tabbed detail views
- Dense, color-coded data table with raw/percentile toggle
- Stacked time-series charts
- Interactive game log with season selector

### Notes
- Progressive disclosure from high-level context (bio, depth chart, schedule) to season tables to game-level detail
- Percentile heatmap normalizes interpretation across seasons and stats
- Career chart overlays league distribution via per-season box plots for immediate comparative context
- Utility features (search, voice beta, theme toggle) are accessible but unobtrusive

## Key Modules

### 1. Player Summary
- Description: Establishes identity and context quickly—who the player is, where he plays, age/draft info, and role context
- Core Elements: Name, position, physicals, team logo; draft/age/college or country
- Interaction Patterns: Passive summary; links via team logo/name likely route to team pages (implied by nav model)
- Notes: Sets anchor for subsequent performance data; reduces need to cross-navigate for basics

### 2. Team Depth Chart + Upcoming Games
- Description: Situates the player within team role and near-term opponents, which affects minutes, usage, and matchup expectations
- Core Elements: Position-based depth chart with player highlighted; next five games with opponents/dates
- Interaction Patterns: Passive reference; no noted filters
- Notes: Lightweight context module that answers common follow-ups without leaving the page

### 3. Content Tabs (Expected, Actual, Shooting)
- Description: Segments analysis modes (observed results vs. model-based vs. shot detail) to reduce cognitive load
- Core Elements: Three tabs; “Actual” active in this view
- Interaction Patterns: Tab switch persists main layout but swaps data sources/metrics
- Notes: Clear separation of conceptual frames (outcomes vs. expectations) avoids mixed interpretations

### 4. Advanced Stats Table
- Description: Season-level breakdown across role, efficiency, location, rebounding, handling, defense—enables longitudinal comparison
- Core Elements: Columns grouped by category (Role/Usage; Estimated +/-; Efficiency/TS%; Location splits; Rebound; Handle; Defense); toggle for raw numbers vs. league percentile; color scale from red to green; mini bar charts for shot frequency by area
- Interaction Patterns: Sortable columns; sticky headers on scroll; hover tooltips with metric definitions; percentile toggle for rapid context switching
- Notes: Heatmap plus percentiles provides instant comparative read without secondary lookups

### 5. Trend Visualizations
- Description: Converts tabular seasons and games into trajectories to detect improvement, consistency, and slumps
- Core Elements: Career EPM line with per-season box plots (5th/25th/50th/75th/95th); current-season game-by-game EPM with 5-game moving average
- Interaction Patterns: Passive viewing; smoothing applied by default
- Notes: Box plots convey league context at a glance; moving average reduces noise without losing directionality

### 6. Game Log
- Description: Ground truth of game outcomes and per-game stats; supports drill-down from season aggregates
- Core Elements: Season selector tabs; row per game with traditional and advanced stats; win/loss color accents
- Interaction Patterns: Tab switch for season; sortable columns likely consistent with table behavior
- Notes: Completes the funnel from overview to atomic events

### 7. Global Navigation and Utilities
- Description: Ensures discoverability and personalization (search, voice beta, theme, account)
- Core Elements: Primary menu (Ratings, EPM, Teams/Players, Stats/Tools, Predictions, About); Teams/Players dropdown grouped by conference; search, voice, theme toggle, login/subscribe
- Interaction Patterns: Persistent header; dropdowns and icon actions

## Best Ideas

### 1. Percentile Toggle + Heatmap in Dense Tables
- Why It Works: Converts absolute stats into relative context without extra clicks. Color assists preattentive scanning; the toggle preserves access to raw values when needed
- Where It Breaks Down: Tail compression—extreme values can look similar at the 95th+ percentile; color reliance can hinder color-blind users without alternative cues or patterns
- Notes: Combine with numeric percentile text or doubly encode to improve accessibility

### 2. Progressive Disclosure from Summary to Game Log
- Why It Works: Matches analyst workflow: orient → compare seasons → inspect trends → audit individual games. Reduces early cognitive load and keeps deep data available
- Where It Breaks Down: Long pages can make re-finding sections tedious without section TOC or in-page jump links

### 3. Trend Lines with League Box-Plot Overlays
- Why It Works: A single chart shows player trajectory and league distribution, enabling season-over-season benchmarking without switching views
- Where It Breaks Down: Mixed encodings can overwhelm on smaller screens; box plots need concise legends and hover details to be interpretable

### 4. Context Panels (Depth Chart + Upcoming Schedule) on the Player Page
- Why It Works: Supplies role and opponent context adjacent to performance data, preventing context switching to team/schedule pages
- Where It Breaks Down: Static snapshots can go stale; lacks filters (e.g., projected lineups, injury status) to reflect imminent changes

### 5. Table Affordances that Teach and Guide (Sorting, Sticky Headers, Tooltips)
- Why It Works: Sorting supports quick pattern finding; sticky headers maintain orientation; tooltips reduce jargon cost by defining metrics in place
- Where It Breaks Down: Sorting interactions plus percentile toggles can create state complexity; persistent indicators of active sort and mode mitigate confusion

## Metadata

### Data Density
High. Broad metric coverage across seasons and games. Readability aided by color encoding, grouping, sticky headers, and tooltips.

### Notable Omissions
- Comparison tools: no side-by-side player compare or cohort benchmarks on this view
- Filters/splits: no visible filters for opponent, home/away, lineup/on-off, clutch time, or date ranges in the game log and charts
- Export/sharing: no CSV export, image download, or deep-link to a specific table state
- Methodology transparency: no inline explanation for EPM model versions or season-to-season changes; no minutes/possessions thresholds shown for percentiles
- Accessibility: color-blind safe alternatives to red–green scale not evident
- Customization: smoothing window on game chart not adjustable; percentile bucketing not configurable
- Mobile/responsive behavior not described; long tables may be challenging without column pinning on small screens

### Misc Notes
- Voice search marked beta; theme toggle supports light/dark
- Subscription gating indicated (“Subscribe for complete access”)
- League navigation via Teams/Players dropdown accelerates cross-entity exploration
- Win/loss color accents in game log provide quick outcome parsing
