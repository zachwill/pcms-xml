  description: "Alerts are items that describe interesting things happening during a game. These could be player milestones, team runs, career or season highs, or just Player X is having a good game. These endpoints are meant to surface the best alerts for a game at the time the request is made. Meaning, an alert could be considered a top alert in period 1, but fall in ranking as the game moves along.\n"
