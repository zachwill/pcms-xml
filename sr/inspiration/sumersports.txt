# SumerSports Depth Chart

## Overview
A visual, interactive depth chart that prioritizes a drag-and-drop board over a traditional table. Users can reorganize player cards and apply data overlays without leaving the primary view.

## Layout

### Global Header
- Fixed header with title "DEPTH CHART" on the left
- Standard icons on the right: Settings, Notifications, Help, User Profile

### Primary View & Data Toggle
- Left: switch between visual depth chart (active) and a table/list view
- Center: data overlays — Biometrics, Performance, Cap, Character — that change indicators on player cards

### Secondary View Controls
- Dropdowns: Team, formation (e.g., Nickel), personnel groupings, depth level (e.g., 2-Deep)
- Special Teams button for a separate view

### Vertical Navigation Bar
- Persistent left rail linking to other sections (e.g., Scouting, Analytics)

### Main Content Area (Board)
- Dotted grid canvas organizing players into vertical positional columns
- Positional columns labeled (e.g., QB, LB) with player counts
- Player cards: name, status, photo/silhouette, key metrics; draggable within and between columns
- Notepad widget ("NOTEPAD"): floating, timestamped, collaborative notes applicable to the full roster

## Best Ideas and Effective Features

- Interactive, visual depth chart
  - Drag-and-drop player cards enable quick roster experimentation without spreadsheet-style editing

- Contextual data overlays
  - Toggling Biometrics, Performance, Cap, or Character updates on-card indicators
  - Example: switch to Cap to see financial implications of a proposed lineup

- Integrated, collaborative notepad
  - Timestamped comments (e.g., “Need more depth at LG”) keep context adjacent to the relevant position and preserve decision history

- Dynamic scenario filtering
  - Formation, personnel, and depth-level controls simulate packages (e.g., Base to Nickel) to reveal strengths and gaps

- Information-dense player cards
  - Combine name, a visual status indicator (multi-colored bar), and a key metric (e.g., SNAPS) for quick scanning without opening a profile
