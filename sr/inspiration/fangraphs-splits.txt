# FanGraphs — Splits Leaderboard

## Overview

### Description
An interactive leaderboard for MLB batting and pitching that lets users segment results by situational "splits" and time windows, rank entities (players/teams/leagues), compare selected players, and export the resulting data.

### Main UI Patterns
- Control panel that configures a sortable, paginated data table
- Tabbed filters (Quick Splits, Advanced Splits, Filters) for progressive disclosure
- Applied filters summary (tokens) with inline removal and reset
- Secondary comparison module for building custom player lists

### Notes
- Progressive complexity management via tabs keeps entry simple while exposing depth on demand
- Context-aware controls: switching Batting/Pitching or Player/Team/League reconfigures downstream options
- Time filters combine presets, season/period toggles, and a calendar picker in one row
- Direct export sits at the point of data consumption, reducing friction

## Key Modules

### 1. Primary Entity, Stat Type, and Grouping
- Description: Establishes the scope and shape of the leaderboard so subsequent filters and columns stay relevant
- Core Elements:
  - Entity toggles: Player, Team, League, MLB
  - Stat type: Batting or Pitching
  - Grouping: Season, Career, Month, etc.
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Context switching updates available splits, stats, and columns
  - Grouping changes row aggregation (e.g., monthly rows vs. career totals)

### 2. Split Selection (Tabbed: Quick, Advanced, Filters)
- Description: Lets users compose situational queries from simple presets to granular multi-dimensional filters
- Core Elements:
  - Quick Splits: One-click common scenarios (Home/Away, vs. LHP/RHP)
  - Advanced Splits: Categorized dropdowns (Handedness, Home/Away, Batted Balls, Situation, Count, Leverage, Weather, Park, etc.)
  - Filters: Numeric thresholds and ranges (e.g., PA minimums, BA > .300)
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Tabs manage cognitive load; selections add to an applied splits list
  - Multi-select and category scoping build compound queries
- Note: "Auto PT" sets a context-appropriate playing time minimum to suppress noise

### 3. Time-Based Filters
- Description: Aligns analysis to specific periods without rebuilding the query
- Core Elements:
  - Presets: Months, Day/Night, First/Second Half
  - Predefined ranges: Last 7/30 days, specific seasons
  - Custom date range via calendar picker
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Combining presets with custom ranges enables quick iteration on time windows

### 4. Applied Splits & State Management
- Description: Centralizes the active query state for review, removal, and reset
- Core Elements:
  - Chip list or summary tokens of active splits and filters
  - Controls: Remove individual tokens, Reset, Auto PT toggle
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Edits are reversible and localized; no need to dive back into nested menus

### 5. Statistic View Selector
- Description: Switches the data table’s column schema to match analytical intent
- Core Elements:
  - Presets like Standard, Advanced, Batted Balls
- Interaction Patterns:
  - One-click column set switching; sort state applies to the current view

### 6. Data Grid Display
- Description: Presents query results for ranking, scanning, and drill-through
- Core Elements:
  - Sortable headers; pagination and page-size controls
  - Player links to profile pages
  - Export Data button above the grid
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Click-to-sort re-ranks without re-querying filters
  - Export provides the current slice for external analysis

### 7. Custom Player Tool
- Description: Purpose-built comparison list that bypasses the leaderboard’s rank-first model
- Core Elements:
  - Search/add players, maintain a custom list, show split-aligned stats
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Shares the same split/time context; isolates a subset for direct comparison

## Best Ideas

### 1. Progressive disclosure via Quick vs. Advanced splits
- Why It Works: Reduces initial cognitive load; common tasks are one click away while advanced users can opt into depth
- Where It Breaks Down: Advanced options can become hard to discover if hidden by default; consider subtle prompts or usage-based surfacing

### 2. Applied Splits as a persistent query summary
- Why It Works: Externalizes state so users can verify and edit complex queries without retracing navigation
- Where It Breaks Down: Long token lists can wrap or overflow; token labels need consistent, compact naming to remain scannable

### 3. Granular filters grouped by analyst mental models
- Why It Works: Categories like Handedness, Situation, and Count map to how questions are framed, accelerating lookup
- Where It Breaks Down: Overlapping categories or ambiguous placement create friction; category definitions must be mutually understood

### 4. Dual-purpose control panel that reconfigures downstream UI
- Why It Works: Switching Batting/Pitching or Entity prunes irrelevant options, keeping the interface focused
- Where It Breaks Down: Context switches that reset prior selections can feel destructive; preserve compatible state when possible and communicate what changed

### 5. Separate "Custom Players" comparison module
- Why It Works: Distinguishes discovery/ranking from head-to-head comparison so each workflow stays optimized
- Where It Breaks Down: Split brain if users expect inline compare within the table; consider cross-links or "send selection to compare" affordances

### 6. Immediate export at the point of analysis
- Why It Works: Acknowledges external workflows; shortens the path from insight to modeling
- Where It Breaks Down: Limited formats, lack of column selection, or excluding sort/filter state reduces usefulness; clearly encode query parameters in the export

## Metadata

### Data Density
- High control density up front balanced by tabbed disclosure
- Dense, sortable table with preset column schemas rather than fully custom column builders
- Time filters, applied tokens, and view toggles coexist without crowding the grid

### Notable Omissions
- Saved views/presets and easy share links for a query state (naming, pinning)
- Inline metric definitions/tooltips on column headers within the grid (glossary may exist elsewhere but isn’t specified here)
- Multi-column sort, pinned columns, or column-level customization beyond preset views
- Lightweight visualizations (sparklines, distribution overlays) for context at a glance
- Empty-state guidance when filters return no results; undo/history of query edits
- Mobile-first patterns for deep filtering; keyboard shortcuts for power users
- API linkage or reproducible query URLs documented alongside Export

### Misc Notes
- Link to "Traditional Leaderboards" provides a simpler pathway for basic tasks
- "Auto PT" is a pragmatic noise filter worth generalizing to other domains as a "context-aware minimum sample size"
- Data freshness and source credits build trust; player links support drill-through
