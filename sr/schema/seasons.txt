### seasons

This table stores unified league and season metadata across SportRadar basketball collections (NBA, NCAA, G-League, International). It maps the various season types (REG, POST, PRE, etc.) to a consistent schema for easy lookup.

- season_id text [PRIMARY KEY] — SportRadar UUID for the season (e.g., "0ab3f16a-a7b3-4d19-b47d-23a47a323228")
- source_api text NOT NULL — One of: 'nba', 'ncaa', 'gleague', 'intl'
- league_id text NOT NULL — SportRadar UUID for the league
- league_name text — Human-readable league name (e.g., "NBA", "NBA G League")
- league_alias text — Short league alias (e.g., "NBA", "NBDL", "NCAAM")
- season_year integer NOT NULL — The 4-digit start year of the season (e.g., 2024)
- season_type text NOT NULL — The type of season. Common values:
    - `PRE`: Preseason
    - `REG`: Regular Season
    - `POST` / `PST`: Postseason / Playoffs
    - `IST`: In-Season Tournament (NBA)
    - `SC`: Showcase Cup (G-League)
    - `PIT`: Play-In Tournament (NBA)
    - `CT`: Conference Tournament (NCAA)
- season_name text — Human-readable season name if provided (e.g., "2024-25 Regular Season")
- is_current boolean DEFAULT false — Whether this is the currently active season
- status text — Current status of the season (e.g., "scheduled", "inprogress", "closed")
- start_date date — The scheduled start date of the season
- end_date date — The scheduled end date of the season

**Constraints:**
- `PRIMARY KEY (season_id)`
- `UNIQUE (source_api, league_id, season_year, season_type)`

**Notes:**
- SportRadar's `Seasons` endpoint provides the bulk of this data.
- The `season_type` values can vary slightly between leagues; we preserve the SportRadar codes but document them here.
- `season_year` usually refers to the year the season begins (e.g., "2024" for the 2024-25 NBA season).
- This table allows joining games and statistics to a specific season context across all supported leagues.
