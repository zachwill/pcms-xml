### injuries

Daily and seasonal player injury reports and statuses. This table tracks individual injury records for players across teams and leagues.

- injury_id text [primary key] -- SportRadar UUID for the injury record
- sr_id text [not null] -- Reference to sr.players
- sr_team_id text [not null] -- Reference to sr.teams (the team the player was on when injured)
- source_api text [not null] -- nba, ncaa, gleague, intl
- status text -- e.g., "Out For Season", "Day-To-Day", "Out"
- description text -- e.g., "Knee", "Ankle", "ACL"
- comment text -- Detailed notes from SportRadar
- start_date date -- When the injury was first reported
- update_date date -- When the injury status was last updated
- is_active boolean DEFAULT true -- Whether the injury is currently active in the latest feed

**Constraints**
- PRIMARY KEY (injury_id)

**Notes**
- This table covers both "Daily Injuries" (which provide updates) and the general "Injuries" (active) endpoints.
- When ingesting the active "Injuries" endpoint, existing injuries for a team that are NOT in the feed should likely be marked `is_active = false`.
- If SportRadar re-uses `injury_id` across updates for the same injury, UPSERT will work correctly.
- If multiple injuries exist for a player, they will be separate rows.
