### league_leaders

This table stores pre-calculated league leader rankings from SportRadar. While these rankings can be derived from `sr.season_player_statistics`, the API provides canonical rankings with specific qualifying criteria that may differ from manual calculations.

- leader_id text PRIMARY KEY — Generated: `{season_id}:{category}:{rank}`
- source_api text NOT NULL — 'nba', 'ncaa', 'gleague'
- season_id text NOT NULL — FK to `sr.seasons`
- season_year integer — Denormalized for quick filtering
- season_type text — REG, PST, etc.
- category text NOT NULL — Statistical category (e.g., "points", "rebounds", "assists", "steals", "blocks", "fg_pct", "fg3_pct", "ft_pct")
- rank integer NOT NULL — Player's rank in this category (1 = leader)
- sr_id text NOT NULL — FK to `sr.players`
- sr_team_id text — FK to `sr.teams`
- player_name text — Denormalized for display
- team_alias text — Denormalized for display
- value numeric(10,3) — The statistical value (e.g., 30.1 PPG)
- games_played integer — Number of games for qualification
- is_tied boolean DEFAULT false — Whether this rank is tied with another player

**Constraints:**
- `PRIMARY KEY (leader_id)`
- `UNIQUE (season_id, category, rank, sr_id)` — Handles ties
- `INDEX (season_id, category)`
- `INDEX (sr_id)`

**Notes:**
- Source: `League Leaders` endpoint (`/seasons/:year/:type/leaders`)
- Categories vary by league but typically include: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, fg_pct, fg3_pct, ft_pct, minutes, double_doubles, triple_doubles
- The API applies its own qualifying minimums (e.g., minimum games played, minimum attempts for percentages)
- This table enables fast "Leaderboard" UIs without recalculating ranks
- For NCAA, leaders may be scoped by conference or division
