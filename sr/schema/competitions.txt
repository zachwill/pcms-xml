### competitions

This table stores competition metadata for International (INTL) basketball. The INTL API covers 200+ competitions across regions, each with its own hierarchy of categories, seasons, and stages.

- competition_id text PRIMARY KEY — SportRadar competition URN (e.g., "sr:competition:156")
- source_api text NOT NULL — 'intl'
- name text NOT NULL — Competition name (e.g., "EuroLeague", "BBL", "Liga ACB")
- alias text — Short alias if available
- gender text — 'men' or 'women'
- type text — 'club' or 'national' (club competitions vs national team events)
- parent_id text — Parent competition ID for nested hierarchies
- category_id text — Category ID (typically country/region)
- category_name text — Category name (e.g., "Germany", "Europe")

**Constraints:**
- `PRIMARY KEY (competition_id)`
- `INDEX (category_id)`
- `INDEX (parent_id)`

---

### season_stages

This table captures the stage/phase structure within an INTL season. Many international competitions have multiple stages (group stage, knockout rounds, etc.).

- stage_id text PRIMARY KEY — SportRadar stage URN (e.g., "sr:stage:123456")
- season_id text NOT NULL — FK to `sr.seasons`
- competition_id text — FK to `sr.competitions`
- source_api text NOT NULL — 'intl'
- name text — Stage name (e.g., "Regular Season", "Playoffs", "Group Stage")
- type text — 'league', 'cup', 'group', 'knockout'
- phase text — e.g., "regular season", "playoffs", "finals"
- order_num integer — Display order within season
- start_date date
- end_date date

**Constraints:**
- `PRIMARY KEY (stage_id)`
- `INDEX (season_id)`

---

### season_groups

For group-stage competitions (common in INTL), this table stores the group definitions.

- group_id text PRIMARY KEY — SportRadar group URN
- stage_id text NOT NULL — FK to `sr.season_stages`
- season_id text NOT NULL — FK to `sr.seasons`
- source_api text NOT NULL — 'intl'
- name text — Group name (e.g., "Group A", "Group B")
- order_num integer — Display order

**Constraints:**
- `PRIMARY KEY (group_id)`
- `INDEX (stage_id)`

**Notes:**
- Source: `Competitions`, `Competition Info`, and `Season Links` endpoints
- The INTL hierarchy is: Category → Competition → Season → Stage → Group
- Games reference `competition_id`, `stage_type`, `stage_phase`, and `group_name` directly for query convenience
- These tables provide the lookup/registry for those references
- `type` distinguishes club tournaments (EuroLeague) from national team events (EuroBasket)
