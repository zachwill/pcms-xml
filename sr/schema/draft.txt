### draft

**Notes:**
- This table combines "Draft Summary" (live picks), "Prospects"/"Top Prospects" (biographical), and "Trades" (transactional history).
- `draft_id` should be stable. Since SportRadar pick IDs might not be present for all years, a composite key `{source_api}_{year}_{round}_{pick}` is a safe fallback for uniqueness.
- `prospect_id` and `player_id` may differ; `player_id` is assigned once they enter the league/system.
- `trades_json` captures the movement of the pick prior to or during the draft.
- Height and weight follow the same integer convention as the `players` table.
